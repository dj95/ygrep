## üì¶ Requirements

- Golang(>=1.11) *(for building ygrep)*
- üöß Make *(dev dependency)*
- üöß staticcheck *(dev dependency)*
- üöß golint *(dev dependency)*


## üîß Installation

- Download the binary from the release page for your platform or run `go build -o ygrep cmd/ygrep/main.go`
- Copy the binary to a location in your `$PATH` (e.g. for linux `sudo cp ygrep /usr/local/bin/.`)


## üöÄ Usage

ygrep will help you to find key-value pairs in yaml files. For example if you'd like to
search for the all keys containing 'foo' and their related values in the `./test` directory,
you can use the commandline `ygrep -p ./test -e '.*foo.*'`. For searching recursively through
all subdirectories of `./test`, use `ygrep -rp ./test -e '.*foo.*'`.

Feel free to test those commands with the provided yml files in the `./test` directory provided
in this repository. The first example should look like the following listing:

```
$ ./bin/ygrep -p ./test -e 'foo'
:: ./test/foo.yml
foo: bar

```

Please refer to the help page (use `-h` as flag) for more options.


## ‚úÖ Testing

Run `make tests` in order to run the tests for this application.
After running tests you will find a coverage report in the `./report` directory.
